# Cognitive Research Project

## Examining the Relationship Between Executive Functions and Experience in the Action Video Game Overwatch

A repository for my disseration analysis code.

## Project Details

Code to process the raw data from the input folder is included in this repository. The R files are seperated into 5 different R scripts. Running the master script will run the remaining R scripts and this will process all the data. Summaries of the analyses can be observed by running the summary code at the bottom of the master file.

Analysis outputs can also be found in the output folder. All variables were Z transformed before analysis.

The project was written in **R script** using the following packages
- tidyverse version 1.3.0
- corrplot version 0.90
- pastecs version 1.3.21
- stargazer version 5.2.2
